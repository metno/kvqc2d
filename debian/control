Description: Non-real-time and geo-statistical quality controls. 
 The geo-statistical algorithms will make up the QC2-ROM (space-control) 
 and will rely on: handling of data-sets comprising points from the 
 whole station network of interest, filtering of uncertain values before 
 and after checks, gridding of data and iterative techniques, 
 kriging interpolation and cross-validation, as well as the additional 
 user-defined algorithms performing specific checks on data selected 
 by the QC2-ROM engine in both time and space.
