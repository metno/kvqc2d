Description: Non-real-time and geo-statistical quality controls.
 The geo-statistical algorithms will make up the QC2-ROM (space-control)
 and will rely on: handling of data-sets comprising points from the
 whole station network of interest, filtering of uncertain values before
 and after checks, gridding of data and iterative techniques,
 kriging interpolation and cross-validation, as well as the additional
 user-defined algorithms performing specific checks on data selected
 by the QC2-ROM engine in both time and space.
